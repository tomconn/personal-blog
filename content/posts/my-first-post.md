## Welcome to the Blog!

This is my first post using Hugo and the awesome space-themed CSS.

Here's a list of things I might write about:

*   Planetary exploration
*   New telescope discoveries
*   The physics of black holes
*   Maybe even some sci-fi!

Check out this cool image (make sure you have `static/images/placeholder.jpg`):

You can also embed videos, like this placeholder YouTube embed (requires `unsafe = true` in `config.toml`):

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

> This is a blockquote. Isn't space fascinating? It really makes you think about our place in the universe.

Let's add some `code` inline and a block of code:

```bash
# Example command
hugo server -D
