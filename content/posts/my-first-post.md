Welcome to the first post on the new SoftwareStable blog! This site is built using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Why Hugo?

Hugo is known for its incredible speed and simplicity. It takes Markdown files and templates and renders a complete static website.

*   Fast build times
*   Easy content creation in Markdown
*   Flexible templating
*   No database needed

## Styling

The visual theme uses CSS variables for colors like `--primary-bg`, `--accent-orange`, and fonts like 'Orbitron' and 'Montserrat'. The layout leverages CSS Flexbox and uses a `.container` class for consistent width.

Here's an example of an embedded image (if you place one in `static/images/`):

```html
<!-- Example Image - replace with your own -->
<!-- <img src="/images/galaxy.jpg" alt="A distant galaxy"> -->
