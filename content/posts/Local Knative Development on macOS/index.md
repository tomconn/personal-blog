# Local Knative Development on macOS (Apple Silicon/ARM64)

This article provides a complete guide and all the necessary scripts to set up a local Knative development environment on an Apple Silicon (ARM64) Mac. It uses Rancher Desktop, Minikube, and a custom Go application to demonstrate a real-world CloudEvents workflow.

Source available from [github.com](https://github.com/tomconn/knative/).

The core of this setup is a robust shell script that automates the creation and destruction of a fully configured Knative cluster.

- **Platform**: macOS (Apple Silicon/ARM64)
- **Container Runtime**: Rancher Desktop v1.19.3
- **Kubernetes**: Minikube (latest) with Kubernetes `v1.32.6`
- **Knative**: Serving & Eventing `v1.18.0`
- **Go**: `v1.24`

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must install the following tools. We recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for easy installation on macOS.

### a. Rancher Desktop

This provides the Docker environment that Minikube will use.
- **Download and install [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)**.
- **Important Configuration**: During the first-run wizard or in `Preferences -> Container Engine`, ensure you select **`dockerd (moby)`** as the container runtime. This is required for Minikube's Docker driver.

If there is a docker.sock error export the following:

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///$HOME/.rd/docker.sock
```

Minikube defaults to 4 cpus and 7GB memory. Ensure Rancher Desktop has been setup 'Preferences' - 'Virtual Machine' - 'Hardware'. Set the '# CPUs' and 'Memory(GB)'.

```bash
function start_cluster() {
    echo "--- 2. Starting Minikube Cluster (${CLUSTER_PROFILE}) ---"
    minikube start \
      --profile "${CLUSTER_PROFILE}" \
      --driver=docker \
      --cpus=4 \
      --memory=7g \
      --kubernetes-version=${KUBERNETES_VERSION}

    minikube profile "${CLUSTER_PROFILE}"
    echo "--- 3. Waiting for Kubernetes API server to be ready ---"
    kubectl wait --for=condition=Available=True deployment/coredns -n kube-system --timeout=300s
}
```

### b. Command-Line Tools (via Homebrew)

If you don't have Homebrew, [install it first](https://brew.sh/). Then, open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Install Go (for building the app)
brew install go

# Install Minikube (for the Kubernetes cluster)
brew install minikube

# Install the Knative CLI (kn)
brew install kn
```

`kubectl` and `docker` CLIs are automatically installed and configured by Rancher Desktop.

---

## 2. Environment Setup

This step uses the provided script to create a fully configured Knative cluster on your machine.

### a. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomconn/knative.git
cd knative
```

### b. Make the Scripts Executable

```bash
chmod +x scripts/manage-cluster.sh
```

### c. Start the Knative Cluster

Run the `start` command. This process will take several minutes as it downloads container images and sets up the cluster.

```bash
./scripts/manage-cluster.sh start
```

**🔑 Sudo Password**: You will be prompted for your macOS password one time. This is required for `minikube tunnel` to create a network route from your Mac to the cluster, which is essential for accessing your services.

When the script finishes, you will have a ready-to-use Knative cluster with a "magic" `sslip.io` domain configured for easy access.

---

## 3. The Go CloudEvents Application

This repository includes a sample Go application (`cmd/event-display/main.go`) that acts as a sink for CloudEvents. It's designed to:
- Receive events via HTTP POST requests.
- Parse them using the official CloudEvents Go SDK.
- Log the event's type and source to the console.

It is built to be a native ARM64 binary for compatibility with Apple Silicon hardware.

---

## 4. Build and Push the Application Image

To run our Go app in Knative, we need to build it into a container image and push it to a registry. We will use the GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`).

**Important**: Because our local machine is ARM64, we will perform a **multi-arch build**. This creates an image that works on both ARM64 (like our Mac) and AMD64 (common in cloud environments).

### a. Log in to GitHub Container Registry

You need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `write:packages` scope.
[Create a PAT here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).
Log in via the Docker CLI, using your GitHub username and the PAT as the password.

```bash
# Replace <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME> with your actual username
export GITHUB_USER="<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>"

echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u $GITHUB_USER --password-stdin
```

### b. Build and Push the Multi-Arch Image

The `docker buildx` command handles building for multiple platforms and pushing in a single step.

```bash
# Define the image name
export IMAGE_NAME="ghcr.io/${GITHUB_USER}/event-display:latest"

# Build for both ARM64 and AMD64 and push to the registry
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 \
  --tag $IMAGE_NAME \
  --push \
  .
```

Your container image is now available at your public GitHub Packages repository.

## 5. Deploy and Test the Knative Application

Now we will deploy two Knative components:
A `PingSource` that generates a new CloudEvent every minute.
Our `event-display` service to receive and log these events.

### a. Deploy the PingSource and the Service

Create a file named `deploy.yaml` with the following content. **Remember to replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>`** with your actual GitHub username.

```yaml
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
kind: PingSource
metadata:
  name: cron-ping-source
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *" # Every minute
  contentType: "application/json"
  data: '{"message": "Hello from PingSource!"}'
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
---
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: ghcr.io/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/event-display:latest
```

Apply this configuration to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
```

### b. Verify the Setup

#### Make the Script Executable

If you haven't already, give the new script execute permissions.
```bash
chmod +x scripts/run-event-display.sh
```

#### Run the Deployment Script

Execute the script from the root of the project. It will handle cleaning up old resources, deploying the new ones, and verifying that the service starts correctly.

```bash
./scripts/run-event-display.sh
```

Wait about a minute for the first ping event to be sent. We can watch the logs of our `event-display` pod to see the events as they arrive.

#### Verify Event Receipt

Once the script completes successfully, it will provide you with the final command needed to see your application in action.

1.  **Wait for the first event:** The `PingSource` is configured to send an event once every minute.
2.  **Watch the logs:** Run the command provided by the script's output to follow the logs of your running container.

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -l serving.knative.dev/service=event-display -c user-container --follow
    ```

You have successfully completed the entire workflow when you see the following output appear in your terminal, repeating every minute:

```
Received a CloudEvent!
  - Type: dev.knative.sources.ping
  - Source: /apis/v1/namespaces/default/pingsources/cron-ping-source
  - Subject:
  - Data: {"message":"Hello from Knative Eventing!"}
```
---

**Congratulations!** You have a fully working local Knative environment receiving and processing CloudEvents.

## 6. Cleanup

When you are finished, you can completely remove the cluster and all related resources by running the `destroy` command.

```bash
./scripts/manage-cluster.sh destroy
```

This will stop the tunnel process and delete the Minikube cluster, returning your system to a clean state.
